# userInterface
This is a dynamic user interface I developed for the company Camara Education. It is to be used by primary and secondary students 
in schools across several different African countries. The purpose of the gui is help students search and navigate to educational
software installed on their computers. It is designed to run on Edubuntu 14.04, a distribution of Ubuntu specifically for 
education.
